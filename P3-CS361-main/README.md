* Author: Chase Davis and Dylan Hiersekorn
* Class: CS361 Section #002
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

This project simulates a Turing Machine (TM) with an infinite tape. It reads a TM input string 
from a file, simulates the machine, and prints the tape after the machine halts.

## Reflection

Overall this project went well and we did not have too many issues. It was more challenging than
the last two projects because there wasn't any starting code and the concepts were a little harder
however, it was a fun challenge to complete. The partner format helped a lot with completing this
project as we are both very busy and would not have had enough time to finish this on our own.

The concepts of this project were very clear. There was no misunderstanding of the requirements
or expectations. If we were to do this project in the future the only thing that we would change would
be the time we started working. The biggest issue was the time crunch towards the end of the deadline.
If we were to start working earlier then we would have avoided any time constraints we experienced.


## Compiling and Using

In order to compile this code navigate to the correct project directory. When in the
directory use the command:
    javac tm.*.java 
This will compile every file that is needed.
To run the simulation run the command:
    java tm/TMSimulator test.TESTFILE


## Sources used

The main sources we used for this project were the class lectures and our previous projects.
The lectures were able to help us understand the concepts and logic behind what we had to do.
The previous projects had some code that we were able to reuse and repurpose in order to make
the project a little easier and quicker than starting from scratch.
