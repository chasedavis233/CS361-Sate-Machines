## Overview

This project creates a custom complete DFA with user choice of manipulation of states, transitions, final, and start states.

## Reflection

Overall this project went well and did not have many issues along the way. The partner format
helped with every aspect of the project. It allowed each of us to focus on our strengths and
work together. It also allowed us to pick up on each others struggles and made every part of
the project easier. We had a little struggle towards the end with the toString method. We were
failing only a few select tests which took some time to figure out but eventually we were able 
to fix all the issues and get everything working.

The concepts of this project were very clear. There was no misunderstanding of the requirements
or expectations. This project helped both of us develop a deeper understanding of DFAs and how
they work. If we were to do this project in the future the only thing that we would change would
be the time we started working. The biggest issue was the time crunch towards the end of the deadline.
If we were to start working earlier then we would have avoided any time constraints we experienced.


## Compiling and Using

In order to compile this code navigate to the correct project directory. When in the
directory use the command:
javac fa/dfa/DFA.java 
This will compile every file except the test class. In order to compile the test class 
use the command: 
javac -cp junit-platform-console-standalone-1.12.0-RC1.jar;. test/dfa/DFATest.java
This will compile the test class. After this just run the test class by using:
java DFATest


## Sources used

The main two sources we used for this project was the class slides and lectures. This gave
us the understanding of DFAs that we needed in order to complete this project. Other than
asking other classmates simple clarifying and understanding questions we only used two sources.
The first sources the the java standard library. We used the second source to help finish the 
toString method. The url for this sources is: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-collectors/
