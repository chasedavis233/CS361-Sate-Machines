* Author: Chase Davis and Dylan Hiersekorn

* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

This project creates a custom complete NFA with user choice of manipulation of states, transitions, final, and start states.

## Reflection

This project went pretty well, with little to no set backs. We were able to covert over alot of out p1 code and work and change stuff off of that project. We found this project to be pretty simple and easy. We pretty much just had to add a few aspects regarding eclosures, and handling multiple transitions. With the midterm, we were a bit time crunched, but managed to get everything done on time with not much issues. 

All the concepts were very clear and this projected helped both of us understand the creation of NFA's a little better like the DGA project. Especially with this project being very similar to the last, we were able to convert the project to NFA with no problems.

## Compiling and Using

In order to compile this code navigate to the correct project directory. When in the
directory use the command:
javac fa/nfa/NFA.java 
This will compile every file except the test class. In order to compile the test class 
use the command: 
javac -cp junit-platform-console-standalone-1.12.0-RC1.jar;. test/nfa/NFATest.java
This will compile the test class. After this just run the test class by using:
java NFATest


## Sources used

The main two sources we used for this project was the class slides and lectures. This gave
us the understanding of NFAs that we needed in order to complete this project. We pretty much just referenced the p1 DFA project and that helped with most of the project.
